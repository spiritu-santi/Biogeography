# Tree Fern Biogeography

Files needed to run the results from:

Ramírez-Barahona S (2023) Laurasian legacies in the Gondwanan tree fern order Cyatheales. bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.13.528358

The repository follows the file system of the R project (R_project.Rproj). All directories are needed to properly run the functions.  
All plots and processing of output was performed in R; the core analyses were performed in RevBayes.  
The script is fully functional, but some of the functions are not yet fully automated and may require additional input.

- The 'inout_data' directory contains the data.  
- The 'code' directory contains the R scripts.  
- The 'rb_out' directory contains the RevBayes scripts.  

The R and RevBayes code was last updated July 10, 2023 and contains all the necessary functions necessary.

Code and data are available at Zenodo:
