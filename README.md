# Tree Fern Biogeography

Files needed to run the results from:

Ramírez-Barahona S (2023) bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.13.528358

The repository follows the file system of the R project (R_project.Rproj). All directories are needed to properly run the functions.  
All plots and processing of output was performed in R; the core analyses were performed in RevBayes.  
The script is fully functional, but some of the functions are not yet fully automated and may require additional input.

- The 'rb_out' directory contains the RevBayes scripts.  
- The 'input_data' directory contains the data.  
- The 'code' directory contains the R scripts to process and visualise the results of the modelling.     

The R and RevBayes code was last updated November 10, 2023 and contains all the necessary functions.

Code and data are available at Zenodo:
